# JSrpg - A simple RPG built in JavaScript
This is a project I started because I wanted to build a simple rpg, to be my first game ever. And what better way than with JS and HTML5 Canvas.
I was inspired by RuneScape's Dungeon System and Stefan Weck's Random Dungeon Generator.

##Features
The game works the same as RuneScape's dungeons, they are created randomly from a determined set of chambers, taking you to solve puzzles in order to get to the last floor and defeat the evil monster.
This game is made to last a certain amount of time depending on your availability. If you have 15 min of free time between two classes, or if you are taking an hour long pause of study you choose the different complexities and the length should be around those times.
